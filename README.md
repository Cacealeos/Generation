> This is a table adaptation of an IP (Generation) that I have been designing for 20 years. I am looking for playtesters to give feedback and test the Sheet worker I wrote. The premise is a hardcore blend of Sci-fiction and Sci-Fantasy that is meant to prioritize the pacing of play to let the players accomplish more in less time by reducing the number of checks that need to be performed.

> ...Orchestrates. People with the gift of manna by Celestials and communicate with Cacealeos, the sentient Universe to control its power...Make real the parts of humanity whose strength is no longer merely figurative and may now content with the power of space: Mind, spirit, body, and memory...
- Characters are humanoid demi gods with the power of the `Manna` called `Orchestrates`.
- Manna manifests the components of humanity to yield power in the form of Catalysts: ==Mental==, ==Body==, ==Spirit==, and ==Memory==. These are used to create an `Aura`.
- An `Aura` gives its user superhuman capabilites that are proportional to its catalysts virtues: ==Power==, ==Flight==, ==Speed==, and ==Endurance==.
- Wield your Aura itself as a weapon and take up arms or use Manna's ability to commune with and command the universe. Such orders and negotiations are called `Magic`.

> ...Humanity is no longer burdened with mortality...
- Manna grants the ability to share memories with Cacealeos. Allows them to "recall" themselves with a meditative trance called `Vitalize`.
- Vitalize restores the user to their prime condition that they self actualize as. This alleviates all ailments for user.
- Vitalize Cures disease, quenches thirst and hunger, removes radiation, restores damage to the body, reconstitutes equipment and returns the user to their self identified age. 
- This is virtual immortality that removes all the cliches from TTRPG. Conflict that arises in Generation matches that of the powerful characters it showcases.

> ...Enter a never before seen Sci-Fi world with Advanced civilizations at the primacy of their existance and not conviently abscent or extinct...
- The gift of manna has forever changed the nature of civilization.
- The lack of a need for food, energy, shelter, or medicine eliminates most economical operations. Civilization is `Post - Scarcity`
- Within the confines of a single galaxy, take command of the intense political climate in the aftermath of the galatic conflict known as the `Celestial Wars`. 
- Six races of Orchestrates: The Ciaha, Magians, Adepts, Arbiters, Riaha, and the Necrians with their own sub races and forms of Government.

| Race | Government |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ciaha | Republic / Federation 
| Adepts | Meritocracy 
| Magians | Monarchy / Kingdom 
| Arbitars | Autocracy / Empire
| Riaha | Confederacy / Confederation
| Necria | Theocracy
